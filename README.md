# Code Refactor

## Refactor a completed website with semantic elements and streamlined CSS

The goal of this project to was to refactor the code base to assist with readability and accessibility.

Prior to the completion of this project, the main code body had no semantic elements. While the visual aspects of the page have not changed, this will provide many benefits. This includes:

-Improved communication with both the browser and search engines.

-Greater flexibility for future styling using specific hooks. 

-Enhanced readability for any later additions.

This project was a great exercise and learning experience for modernizing an existing code base.
